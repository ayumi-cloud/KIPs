## Abstract

Define and implement a refinement to the `fungible-v1` Pact interface to provide a fungible coin or token standard, drawing inspiration
from ERC-20 and related token standards.


## Motivation

The outstanding motivation at time of writing is to ensure interoperability between Kadena `fungible-v2` token,
as implemented in the "coin contract", and tokens that will exist on the system using either the `fungible-v1` or
`fungible-v2` token format.

## Rationale

While `fungible-v1` sought to improve upon existing industry token standards, `fungible-v2` is a further refinement
of what `fungible-v1` sought to accomplish, by adding key model properties and functionality to the `fungible-v1` interface.

### An Alternative Transfer function

While `transfer-create` and `transfer-crosschain` were included in the `fungible-v1` interface as the universal primitives
allowing for transfer of tokens on chains and across chains, `transfer` is an addition user-friendly refinement of `transfer-create`
that allows for transfering tokens on the same chain without having to provide the receipient's account guard, and will fail
if the recipient does not exist. In this sense, the funciton offers a different security model than `transfer-create`,
guarding against the possibility of transfering tokens to an account with the wrong (possibly inaccessible) details, simply consuming gas instead.

### Transfer restrictions not specified

Whitelisting/blacklisting and other security token standards are not specified.


## Backwards Compatibility
